Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

##Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.

- I fetched the data from the API with no issues - I have used the name so far but plan to use the other elements to create a loop in the upgrade setInterval thing (the cost and increase)

##Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
##Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
##Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
##Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.
